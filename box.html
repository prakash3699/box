		<p>For hiring managers, a command of grammar offers honest insight into an applicant’s intelligence, dedication, attention to detail, and professionalism, not to mention communication skills. 
		Your second and maybe third sentences are where you elaborate on your point. All the nonessential information that didn’t fit in your topic sentence goes here. The goal is that the reader fully understands the point, so feel free to include citations or assertions from other sources for stronger communication.</p>

	  <h2>Solution</h2>
	    <p>This began as one paragraph, but needed two—one for the problem and one for the solution. Also, notice that the second paragraph is a process paragraph. It would be very easy to add an introduction and conclusion to these two paragraphs and have a complete essay!
		People often install a kitty door, only to discover that they have a problem. The problem is their cat will not use the kitty door. There are several common reasons why cats won’t use kitty doors. First, they may not understand how a kitty door works. They may not understand that it is a little doorway just for them. Second, many kitty doors are dark, and cats cannot see to the other side. As such, they can’t be sure of what is on the other side of the door, so they won’t take the risk. One last reason cats won’t use kitty doors is because some cats don’t like the feeling of pushing through the door and having the door drag across their back. But don’t worry—there is a solution for this kitty-door problem.</p>

      <h3>Support</h3>
	    <p>SupportGood grammar can even land you that promotion: According to a 2013 study, professionals who have been promoted six to nine times made 45 percent fewer grammar mistakes than those promoted one to four times. 
		Here’s where you get down to brass tacks: Present your evidence, data, statistics, logical conclusions, persuasive opinion, real-life or hypothetical examples, etc.—anything that confirms your initial statement. </p>

	  <h3>Work Hard</h3>
	    <p>I do well in school, and people think I am smart because of it. But it’s not true. In fact, three years ago I struggled in school. However, two years ago I decided to get serious about school and made a few changes. First, I decided I would become interested in whatever was being taught, regardless of what other people thought. I also decided I would work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. I decided to never, never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. After implementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions. Then my test scores began to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made fun of me because “I was smart.” How exciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply a matter of working hard and being interested. After all, learning a new video game is hard work even when you are interested. Unfortunately, learning a new video game doesn’t help you get into college or get a good job.</p>
